* Exercises, Algorithms, Interviews
 
 - A repository of my answers to competitions, interview tasks or standard
   algorithms.

 - There will be answers that I will ommit from this repository as I sometimes:
   - Am unable to add it due to terms and conditions of the competition
   - Forget to add it (happens)
 
 - Sometimes the solutions will be untidy, but that is a reflection of the
   nature of under pressure programming (sometimes)

 - Initially this repository was spread across multiple repositories, for ease
   of reference I have chosen to merge them all in one (this one)
