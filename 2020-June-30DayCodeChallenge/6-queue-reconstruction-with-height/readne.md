As I was writing this I had a MUCH better idea how to do it. And it took me a
while, but I have stretched my knowledge quite a bit especially since for the
first time I used:
1. a makefile
2. Separate files 

I haven't implemented anything smart in here really, but it was more about how I did it
which I'm quite happy about.
