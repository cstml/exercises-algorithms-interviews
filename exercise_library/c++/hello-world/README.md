My first __random__ project on _GitHub_ just to get used to the platform and for the fun of it

## What the code does

This game will try and beat you at guessing a number by generating a random answer. Because it is a diligent program it will not stop until it manages to succeed. But because it is fair as well, it will tell you how long it took it.

## What you do

Hopefully __enjoy!__
