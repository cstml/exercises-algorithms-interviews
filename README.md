# Escape_The_Zombie_Trolls

__A fun project that was created as a challenge to better accustom myself with Python__

## Story

As you were walking back home from the Pub, you pass out on the Northern Line tube for 3 hours. When you wake up, you find yourself in a _Dungeon_. You don't know how you got there and your phone is completely out of battery. _Horrible!_ you say thinking that now you might have to look people in the eye on the tube. Anyway! 

You hear (Zombie)Trolls around you and you freak out. This is no ordinary find your way home after binge drinking.You must try to _escape_!

## Controls
Use WASD to run from the zombies through the maze. When they see you, they will try and catch you.

## The Zombie Trolls
### Movement
The Zombie_Trolls move 1 square at a time. The directions they can move are only in the up down righ or left (no diagonal movement). *That doesn't mean that they will not see you if you are diagonally placed from them though!*

### What happens if they catch you?
You loose.

### What happens if you catch them?
Yet again, you loose.

### What if I push a wall over them?
The Zombie_Troll will get *squashed* and die. No loosing this time.

## Inspiration
the idea of the project came from :
